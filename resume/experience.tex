        {Mar. 2022 - Present}
        {\textbf{Sole engineer handled all the creation of Solana indexing services and its API.}\newline
        Started the foundation of the Solana indexer from scratch and was able to achieve speed on par with Solana validation (\emph{around 4-5K TPS/w-ops}). Also, created the pipeline for development and deployment to production. The whole service and its dependant microservices is my sole responsibility to say. Other than that, created also a complex event bus system which does the whole \textbf{ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)} process. Last thing that I did was create a scalable API solution that could handle 3K load concurrently (on each endpoint) and served the data that I gathered from Solana.}
